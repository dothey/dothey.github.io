As you make your way through a TV series like Game of Thrones or Grey's Anatomy, keeping track of the many characters that pop in and out of each season can get pretty confusing. Our hackathon team has developed an approach to remembering the characters by keeping track of who's sleeping with who. The methodology is simple: given any TV series, our Python script scrapes Wikipedia and IMDB for plot summaries for an entire TV show, and after sorting and evaluating the information about the characters' activities using Natural Language Processing, connects two characters on a graph if they've slept with each other. The resulting graph yields a unbiased judgement of the each of characters. In the future, we hope to improve the detection accuracy of the Natural Language Processing portion of the project so character activities can be more accurately recorded. Honestly we've felt that we've done the binge-watching community a huge favor, and we hope that you'll find it useful too.
